# SIEM Simulation
## Objective:
To explore how a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system helps analysts detect and respond to suspicious activity such as failed logins or unknown IP access.
## What I Expect to Learn:
- How to analyze basic security alerts
- Understanding how SOC teams investigate alerts
- Hands-on interaction with a SIEM interface
- How to capture a flag using simulated data
## What I Learned:
- SIEM systems help centralize and analyze suspicious activities.
- Multiple failed logins followed by a successful one is a suspicious pattern.
- External IPs like `143.110.250.149` flagged as malicious must be blocked.
- Tools like IP scanners help confirm threat sources.
- Analysts use logs, behavior patterns, and threat intel to take action.
## Outcome:
- Flag captured: `THM{THREAT-BLOCKED}` 
- Malicious IP address `143.110.250.149` identified and blocked
- Challenge successfully completed!

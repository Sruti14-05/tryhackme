# SIEM Simulation
## Objective:
To explore how a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system helps analysts detect and respond to suspicious activity such as failed logins or unknown IP access.
## What I Expect to Learn:
- How to analyze basic security alerts
- Understanding how SOC teams investigate alerts
- Hands-on interaction with a SIEM interface
- How to capture a flag using simulated data

_(I will update this file after completing the lab with what I learned.)_

## Objective
Simulate the stages of a real penetration test:
- Receive the scope
- Perform scanning and enumeration
- Exploit the target machine
- Submit a pentest report
- Mitigate threats based on analysis
## Tools Used
- **Nmap / Custom scanner**
- **Metasploit**
- **Burp Suite (optional)**
- **TryHackMe AttackBox**
## Engagement Walkthrough
### 1. Received Scope of Engagement
[screenshot attached] 
Got official permission to start the pentest via internal email.
### 2. Target Identification & Recon
[screenshot attached]  
Found a LinkedIn profile and email from ACME staff (potential social engineering vector).
### 3. Vulnerability Scanning
[screenshot attached]
Scanned the target IP: `96.37.50.151`  
Results:
- Web: ✅ Vulnerable  
- Login: ❌ Not vulnerable
### 4. Exploitation (Metasploit)
[screenshot attached]  
Used Metasploit to exploit the web vulnerability and gain a Meterpreter session.
### 5. Reporting
[screenshot attached]  
Sent a detailed pentest report. Client confirmed the vulnerabilities and cleaned up high-privilege accounts.
### 6. Threat Blocking
[screenshot attached]  
Blocked the malicious IP using a SIEM platform or internal firewall simulation.
## Outcome
- Critical web vulnerabilities discovered and reported
- Successfully exploited target and gained access
- Helped the organization strengthen their security posture
## Lessons Learned
- Importance of defined scope and documentation
- End-to-end engagement simulation builds real skills
- How attackers leverage simple vulnerabilities to gain access
